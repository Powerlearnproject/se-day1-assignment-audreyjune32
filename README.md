# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
a)software engineering refers to software product design,development and testing, deployment and maintanance
its important by enabling the creation of software applications and sysytemsthat power various aspects of modern life, including communication ,entertainment and  healthcare

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
a)agile methodology
b)artificial intelligence
c)cloud computing

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
a)planning-defines project's purpose and the desired result
b)requirements-analyzes the product's goals and decides on the features to aim for as a fine goal
c)design-define how software application works
d)software development-programming is done and programmers ensure the application works efficiently
e)testing-it mitogates bugging , also through different types of testing such as unit testing,code quality
f)deployment-ensures the software is up-to-date and secure enough for users and pushes it from the development environment to a live environment such as an app store
g)Maintanance-the software is successfully launched and is being used
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
In waterfall methodology,the team must execute of every stage completely, the output of one phase is the input of the next phase ,example     while  in agile methodology ,the team agrees on an Minimal viable product with essential features and tries to reach that in as few iterations as possible.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software developer design ,program,build ,deploy, and maintain software using many different skills and tools
quality assurance engineer ensures a product is meeting quality requirements before its launched
project manager ensuresthat projects meet deadlines, stay within the budget and adhere to quality standards


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
enables one to perform version control operations dirfectly from IDE interface
helps programmers develop software code efficiently
makes collaborations amongst developers with different IDES
examples , Eclipse,vs code,IntellJIDEA

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Time constraints
Fast advancements of technology
Software testing conflicts
solution:
a)by changing requirements
restarting the software 
upgrade your OS

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing
Coding quality
Integration testing
Performance testing
Security testing  
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering involves crafting your questions or instructions in a way that helps get the best responses from your robot or AI assistant

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
For example instead of asking"i want to know cake baking" ,which will provide a lot of informations, type"stepwise on how to bake a cake"
